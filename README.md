### Learn Democracy by Living It - An AI-Powered Political Simulation

**HackByte 4.0 | Claw & Shield Track (ArmorIQ x OpenClaw)**

---

## The Problem: Political Illiteracy in the World's Largest Democracy

India has **950 million** eligible voters, yet most citizens:

- Cannot name 3 policies from any party's manifesto
- Don't understand how elections are won or lost beyond caste/religion lines
- Have never experienced the strategic complexity behind policy-making
- Are unaware of election laws like the **Model Code of Conduct**, **RPA Section 125**, or **IPC Section 171**

**Panchayat AI** solves this by letting you *become* a politician. You don't read about democracy — you compete in it against 4 AI opponents who fight back, attack your record, and try to win the electorate. Every attack is validated by a real election code. Every vote you win or lose is earned through **policy, not propaganda**.

---

## What is Panchayat ?

A **turn-based political simulation** where you compete as an independent candidate against 4 AI-powered opponents in a Panchayat (village council) election. Over 5 rounds, you:

1. **Choose manifesto policies** from 50 real-world Indian policy proposals
2. **Watch AI candidates react** in-character with voice (ElevenLabs TTS)
3. **See attacks fly** between candidates - fact-based critiques, public challenges, scandal exposes
4. **Enter the War Room** to launch your own strategic attacks or test illegal moves
5. **Watch votes shift** in real-time as your decisions ripple through 5 voter demographics

The twist: **Every political action is validated by ArmorIQ Shield** - a cryptographic enforcement layer that blocks communal hate speech, personal attacks, fake claims, voter intimidation, and bribery. If an AI (or you) crosses the line, the Election Commission catches it.

## Sponsor Track: Claw & Shield (ArmorIQ x OpenClaw)

### How We Implement Every Hackathon Requirement

| Hackathon Requirement | Our Implementation | Code Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Structured Intent Model** | `PoliticalIntent` class with candidate_id, action_type, target, narrative, SHA-256 intent hash | `bridge/shield_engine.py:67-103` |
| **Policy-based Runtime Enforcement** | 3-layer Shield: Type Check -> Content Regex -> ArmorIQ SDK verification | `bridge/shield_engine.py:216-283` |
| **Separation of Reasoning & Execution** | Claw (reasoning) generates intent -> Shield (execution gate) validates -> Game Engine mutates state | `bridge/claw_agent.py` -> `bridge/shield_engine.py` -> `bridge/api_server.py` |
| **At least 1 Allowed Action** | `policy_critique`, `public_challenge`, `voter_appeal` - all pass Shield | Verified in audit log |
| **At least 1 Blocked Action** | `communal_incitement`, `personal_attack`, `bribery_promise` — deterministically blocked | War Room "OUT OF CODE" attacks |
| **Logged & Explained Decisions** | Every Shield verdict logged to `data/shield_audit_log.json` with reason, policy ref, intent hash, timestamp | `bridge/shield_engine.py:336-368` |
| **No hardcoded shortcuts** | Real Gemini LLM reasoning for candidate reactions; regex + SDK for enforcement; structured JSON policy model | Full stack |

## Features

### 1. Manifesto System - 50 Real-World Indian Policies

Each round presents 10 policies from categories like agriculture, economy, technology, governance, defense, and culture. These are modeled on real Indian policy debates:

- *"Increase MSP by 50% for wheat, rice, and pulses"*
- *"Deploy free 5G connectivity for every village Panchayat"*
- *"Implement blockchain transparency for all Panchayat fund disbursals"*
- *"Mandate 50% women reservation in all Panchayat elections"*

Your choice shapes voter sentiment across 5 demographics with different ideological alignments.

### 2. AI Political Agents - 4 Distinct Ideologies

Each AI candidate is a fully-realized political persona powered by **Google Gemini**:

| Candidate | Party | Archetype | Key Trait |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pt. Vedprakash Shastri** | Sanskriti Seva Dal | Traditionalist | Quotes the Arthashastra; cow-based economics |
| **Arjun Mehra** | Digital Bharat Front | Techno-Populist | IIT alumnus; campaigns on Instagram Reels |
| **Comrade Meera Devi Yadav** | Samta Shakti Morcha | Socialist Reformer | Led the 'Roti Andolan'; fights for daily-wage workers |
| **Nandini Krishnamurthy** | Swatantra Vikas Party | Corporate Libertarian | Former World Bank economist; 1991 reforms veteran |

Each AI reacts in-character to your policies with **ElevenLabs voice synthesis**, creating a living debate experience.

### 3. War Room - Strategic Political Combat

After each round, the **War Room** opens automatically. You:

- See **intelligence dossiers** on each opponent (vote share, threat level, past attacks)
- Choose from **5 legal attacks** per candidate based on manifesto weaknesses
- Can attempt **2 illegal attacks** per candidate (communal hate, personal attacks, bribery)
- Watch **ArmorIQ Shield** catch and block illegal moves in real-time
- See **vote distribution shift dynamically** based on your strategic choice

### 4. Cross-Candidate AI Attacks

AI candidates don't just target you - they **attack each other**. Each AI targets the current election leader with contextual, manifesto-specific critiques:

- *"Your Gau-Krishi scheme costs 500 crore with zero funding"* (vs. Dharma Rakshak)
- *"Your smart village contracts went to party donors"* (vs. Vikas Purush)
- *"Free everything sounds great. Who pays?"* (vs. Jan Neta)

These are drawn from a **168-attack database** (`bridge/warroom_db.py`) covering all candidate-vs-candidate matchups.

### 5. Shield Enforcement - India's Election Laws as Code

The Shield engine maps real Indian election law to AI policy enforcement:

| Violation Type | Legal Reference | Example Blocked |
|---|---|---|
| Communal Incitement | Section 125, RPA | *"Only Hindu values can save this Panchayat"* |
| Personal Attack | Model Code of Conduct | *"Your entire family is corrupt"* |
| Fabricated Claim | Section 171G, IPC | *"He is secretly plotting to sell village land"* |
| Voter Intimidation | Section 171C, IPC | *"If you don't vote for me, schemes will stop"* |
| Bribery Promise | Section 171B, IPC | *"Every family gets Rs 5000 for voting"* |

The engine uses **5 regex pattern engines** for content analysis and supports **ArmorIQ SDK** for cryptographic intent verification when configured.

### 6. Newspaper-Themed UI

The entire interface is designed as a **vintage Indian newspaper** ("The Daily Panchayat"):

- **Masthead** with date, round number, and edition line
- **Manifesto popup** as a multi-page newspaper slide
- **Speech bubbles** styled as editorial columns
- **Action Feed** as "Campaign Dispatches" with APPROVED/BLOCKED stamps
- **Election Forecast** as a newspaper bar chart
- **Voter Sentiment** panel with demographic breakdown

### 7. Unified Sequential Presentation

No chaos, no overlap. A **unified presentation queue** ensures:

1. Each candidate speaks one at a time with voice
2. Campaign attacks shown sequentially with audio
3. War Room opens only after all presentations complete
4. Current audio stops when you skip to the next item

### 8. ElevenLabs Voice Integration

Every AI response uses **ElevenLabs Multilingual v2** with candidate-specific voices:

- Male authoritative voice for Pt. Vedprakash
- Young tech-savvy voice for Arjun Mehra
- Female activist voice for Comrade Meera
- Professional consultant voice for Nandini

Attack narrations also play with TTS, creating an immersive debate experience.

### 9. Dynamic Vote Distribution

Votes shift based on:

- **Policy ideology alignment** - each voter group has different priorities
- **Attack impact modifiers** - scandal exposes hurt targets more than policy critiques
- **Per-candidate score boosts** - accumulated through the entire game
- **AI strategic advantage** - AI candidates have a 1.15x multiplier (seasoned politicians vs newcomer)

### 10. SpacetimeDB - Real-Time Vote Matrix

The election state is backed by a **SpacetimeDB** module that maintains a live **5x5 voter-candidate share matrix**:

- Each of the 5 voter demographics has a percentage allocated to each of the 5 candidates
- Every vote gained by one candidate is a **zero-sum loss** from others
- The `spacetime_client.py` bridge syncs AI actions and player attacks to this matrix in real-time
- Enables instant state consistency across all connected sessions via WebSocket subscriptions

### 11. Complete Audit Trail

Every Shield decision is logged to `data/shield_audit_log.json`:

```json
{
  "verdict": "BLOCKED",
  "intent": {
    "candidate_id": "player",
    "action_type": "communal_incitement",
    "target_id": "dharma_rakshak",
    "narrative": "Only Hindu values can save this Panchayat...",
    "intent_hash": "be0c83e855f1e6b9"
  },
  "reason": "Content analysis detected 'communal_incitement': Violates Section 125 of RPA",
  "policy_ref": "Section 125, Representation of the People Act",
  "enforcement_method": "content_analysis",
  "verdict_time": "2026-04-04T12:35:17.123456"
}
```

## Learning Outcomes for the Player

By playing Panchayat AI, a citizen learns:

| Lesson | How It's Taught |
|---|---|
| **Policy trade-offs** | Choosing "Cancel farmer loans" gains farmer votes but loses business support |
| **Election law** | Attempting communal incitement shows RPA Section 125 block in real-time |
| **Strategic thinking** | Deciding whether to attack the leader or build alliances |
| **Media literacy** | Seeing how attacks are framed as "Campaign Dispatches" |
| **Democratic accountability** | Every action has an audit trail; Shield logs show enforcement |
| **Ideology spectrum** | Understanding why farmers prefer welfare policies while youth want tech |
| **Coalition politics** | AI candidates attack each other; the player navigates between factions |
| **Code of Conduct** | The Model Code of Conduct is not abstract - it's enforced in their game |
